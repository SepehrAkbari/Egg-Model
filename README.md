# Mathematical Modeling Of A Chicken Egg!

This project was part of my Mathematics Internal Assesment for the IB Diploma. It explores the theme of daily oridenry objects being seen and looked at mathematically, I used a chicken egg!

## Project Overview

The project aims to find the volume and surface area of the an ordinary egg:

- Modeling the egg
- Calculating its volume
- Calculating its surface area

## Modeling

Three different ways of modeling was used, and then compared, to find the most suitable and accurate.

- Ellipse Equation
$$
x+y
$$
- Oviform Curve
- Lagrange Interpolation

A python program was used to find its axis symmetry

```{r}
python AxisOfSymmetry.py # change the local image link
```

## Volume
